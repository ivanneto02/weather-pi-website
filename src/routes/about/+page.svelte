<h1>About the WeatherPI Data Viewer</h1>

<p>
	This website is used to visualize the data gathered by BME280 3.3V High Precision (pressure,
	temperature, and humidity sensor), and PMS5003 Digital Particle Concentration Laser Sensor.
</p>

<p>These sensors gather the following data from outside my apartment, located in Riverside, CA:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Temperature</li>
	<li>Humidity</li>
	<li>Atmospheric Pressure</li>
	<li>Particulate Matter Counts</li>
	<li>Different-size Particle Counts</li>
</ul>

<p>
	With the increase of forest fires in the area, it is imperative to create end-to-end pipelines to
	monitor harmful particle concentrations in the air. During a series of fires in 2024, air quality
	was extremely impact, and several cities were forced to close schools and facilities.

		With air quality monitoring tools, we can be better informed when making decisions about public
