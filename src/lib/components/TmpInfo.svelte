	<h2>Temperature Information</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>Sensor: BME280</li>
		<li>Unit: Degrees Celcius (C)</li>
		<li>Protocol: I2C</li>
		<li>Period: 3s</li>
		<li>Average: last 10 samples</li>
		<li>Location: Riverside, CA</li>
		<li>Device: Raspberry Pi 1 2012.11</li>

	<p>
		Temperature is gathered every 3 seconds, averaging the last 10 samples (30 seconds) to quickly
		display real-time data every 5 minutes.
	</p>

	<p>
		The sensor sits in my apartment, which I have been wanting to gather more information about. I
		want to know how quickly and during what intervals the temperatures are changing. Air
		conditioned keeps the apartment at an even 27C most of the time because of my pets. I seek to
		see what happens over periods of time when I'm not home.
